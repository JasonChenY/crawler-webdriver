StandardCharted:  can fetch most of info, but still problem for first job and next page.
ABB: CookieConsentBtn removed.
Nike: Adding Proxy function (need access google CDN), delay 5 seconds before click country selection.
Boehringer-ingelheim: Big, totally different: pDateL removed, cant select jobs via date; new website cannt openInNewTab
Abbott: job_title A anchor tag changed.

todo:

1. apple use ElementsNumChanged to check a page is loaded, which will cause problem for verifier.
2. check why solr will receive page request with incorrect 'start, rows'.
3. improve verifier, is it possible to save jobs for company , where in one batch all jobs are invalidated,
then recheck this in next batch, if any job is passed, then add all those jobs as invalidated.
